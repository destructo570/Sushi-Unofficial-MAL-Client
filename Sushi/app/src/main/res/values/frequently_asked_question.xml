        <item>Currently the official Mal Api is limited in features and doesn\'t offer any of the social features, forums etc.
        When the Mal Api adds all of this functionality to their Api we will add them to the app as well.</item>
        <item>You can\'t see someone\'s anime/manga list from profile section if it\'s private even if it\'s yours. This data is not provided by the official MAL Api, The app
        uses another unofficial api called jikan api for fetching user list and it does not support fetching private data.</item>
        <item>You can share the app and leave a review. Or you can also help translate this app to your language. It would help a lot ðŸ˜ƒ</item>
        <item>If you want to do that please go ahead. It\'s not uncommon for apps to have paid themes and there are many out there which do so.
        If you want free dark theme or other theme options. You can check out other MAL clients like moelist and MalClient on playstore.</item>
